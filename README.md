# Orion A 3D Magnetic Fields

We reconstructed the complete 3D magnetic field morphology of Orion A using Galactic magnetic field models, as well as line-of-sight and plane-of-sky magnetic fields. This 3D field morphology is depicted in the above 3D file (OrionA_B1B2.obj) and in Tahani et al. (2022). Different software, including "meshlab," can be used to view the 3D files.

The file `OrionA_B1.obj' depicts the 3D magnetic field of Orion A, described in Tahani et al. 2022a (B1). The field morphology B2, as discussed in Tahani et al. (2022), is very similar to B1, and is slightly inclined (with respect to the cloud axis) and is shown at a different location of the cloud. The file 'OrionA_B1B2.obj' illustrates both of these fields at the same time. Both of these fields look somewhat like a semi-convex shape from our point of view. However, from the cloud's perpective one (B1) appears to be slightly concave. This is due to the high inclination of the Orion A cloud. Both of these have their centre of bending at greater distances (relative to us) and mostly on the cloud.Â 

'OrionA_B3.obj' OrionA S3 demonstrates a third scenario that, while consistent with line-of-sight and plane-of-sky magnetic fields, is incompatible with the Galactic Magnetic Field Model used in Tahani et al. 2022a (and not accepted).
